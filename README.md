# Queue
this was a midterm exam for my ap course 
the main point was to design a queue so we can categorize students 
* **Queue Class**
Queue class has these members
* **pnext** :
For saving next item address
* **pvalue** :
For saving the item value that we want to keep
* **phead** :
Pointer for saving the head address (first item) 
* **ptail** : 
Pointer for saving tail address (last item)
and these functions 
* **enqueue** :
